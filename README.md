# Planning Smooth Paths For Robots

Honour Project 2021
\
\
Please download the .zip file and run in main.py
\
\
In order to plot a new graph with paths: 
  please initialize PathView with given problem and numbers of approximation of the path at beginning\
  and write pathView.show() at the end\
  \
  For the methods to generate path, you need to give the label as a string for the first argument\
  \
    label of algorithms:\
      bezier\
      bspline\
      cubicspline\
      \
  And the color of the path generated for the second argument\
  K is the distance parameter to control the distance of control points for each algorithms
